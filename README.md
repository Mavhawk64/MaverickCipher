# MaverickCipher
This is a cipher that I created that asks for a seed (or creates one using system time), then it will encrypt the message. You can either print to or read from screen or print to or read from file.  It will also decrypt the message if you know the seed.

Please view the _screen.txt_ file to see what I typed on the input terminal.

Also view the _input.txt_ and output files.
